VBA Scripting Challenge
This submission is for the VBA Challenge for the Data Analytics Bootcamp
First I have created a loop to find the opening and closing price in a year for each type of stock
Then I have found the percentage increase or decrease as well as the total stock volume
Finally, I have conditionally formatted the percentage differences to show which is an increase(green) and which is a decrease (red)
Lastly, I have summarised those stocks in each worksheet that have the Greatest % increase, Greatest % decrease, and the Greatest stock volume overall, per year.
